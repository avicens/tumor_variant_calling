# Identification of somatic variants in tumor samples

Here I describe a pipeline to identify somatic short variants in tumor samples with respect to a matched normal sample.

This workflow include all steps for proccessing whole exome sequencing (WES) data from tumor and paired normal sample and detection of somatic variants.

The different tasks were run in a high-performance computing cluster (*Finisterrae II*) managed by Slurm scheduling system.
