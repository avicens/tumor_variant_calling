# Identification of short somatic variants in tumor samples

## Description
Here it is presented a pipeline to identify somatic short variants in tumor samples with respect to a matched normal sample.

## Environment
The different tasks were run in a high-performance computing cluster (*Finisterrae II*) managed by Slurm scheduling system.

## Sample data
The sample datasets used to test the pipeline are WES data from a colorectal tumor sample and its normal-paired sample.

## Reference genome
The reference human genome used for mapping reads is hg19 (aka b37).
